/**
 * NOTE:
 *
 * 1. Why Svelte AST nodes had to be included?
 *    - During the compilation from Svelte to JS, HTML comments are removed.
 *    - Rollup' internal `this.parse()` excludes `leadingComments` from parsing.
 *      I couldn't find an option to override this behavior.
 *      I wanted to avoid adding another package for parsing _(getting AST)_ - e.g. `acorn`
